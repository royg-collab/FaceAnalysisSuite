# Task_B: Multi-Model Face Recognition Pipeline (Clean + Distorted)

## Project Objective

This project tackles a **multi-class face recognition** challenge under **real-world conditions**, including **distortions** like blur, low light, and occlusion.

The goal is to build a **modular AI system** that can:
- Detect whether an input face image is distorted
- Route it to the appropriate face recognition model
- Predict the correct person identity

---

##  Approach Overview

 Designed a **3-model inference pipeline** that mimics human visual processing:

```
             +----------------------+
             |  Input Face Image    |
             +----------+-----------+
                        |
                        ‚ñº
        +------------------------------+
        |   Model 1: Distortion Class  |
        |   (Clean vs Distorted)       |
        +------------------------------+
             |                |
     Clean Image         Distorted Image
        |                        |
        ‚ñº                        ‚ñº
+----------------+     +-----------------+
|  Model 2        |     |  Model 3        |
|  Clean Face     |     |  Distorted Face |
|  Recognizer     |     |  Recognizer     |
+----------------+     +-----------------+
        |                        |
        +-----------+------------+
                    ‚ñº
         Final Person Prediction
```

##  Model Summary

| Model ID | Purpose                   | Architecture             | Training Data |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Model 1  | Distortion Classifier      | Custom CNN                | Clean + Distorted |
| Model 2  | Face Recognition (Clean)   | MobileNetV3 Small + SE    | Clean images only |
| Model 3  | Face Recognition (Distorted)| MobileNetV3 Small + SE   | Distorted images only |

All models are trained separately and saved, then unified in a prediction pipeline.

## UnifiedFaceAnalyzer

A 3-stage deep learning pipeline for face recognition across both clean and distorted face images using MobileNetV3 in PyTorch.


*This combines three specialized models:
- Distortion Classifier ‚Äì Identifies whether an input face is clean or distorted.
- Clean Face Recognizer ‚Äì Recognizes identities from clean face images.
- Distorted Face Recognizer ‚Äì Recognizes identities from distorted face images (e.g., foggy, blurry, rainy).
These models are unified into a single class: UnifiedFaceAnalyzer.

‚úÖ The .pt file (UnifiedFaceAnalyzer.pt) stores the model weights only. To use it, the architecture must be defined in unified_face_analyzer.py.

‚úÖ Commit both .pt and .py files to GitHub for full reproducibility.

## Testing

A separate test.py script is provided that:
*Accepts a test dataset path (flat folder of images)
*Loads the pretrained unified model
*Outputs classification report and confusion matrix
```
python test.py \
    --model_path UnifiedFaceAnalyzer.pt \
    --test_path /path/to/test_images
```
---
## Test Image Format
Your test_images/ folder should contain files named like:
```
001_frontal_clear.jpg
001_frontal_foggy.jpg
002_frontal_blur.jpg
001_frontal_rainy.jpg
```
Each file is matched to a label in true_labels inside test.py
---
---
## File Usage Guide
```
## üì¶ Model Components

The following files are required to run inference with `UnifiedFaceAnalyzer.pt`:

| File                          | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UnifiedFaceAnalyzer.pt`      | Pretrained weights of the unified model                     |
| `unified_face_analyzer.py`    | Defines the model architecture (must be present to load `.pt`) |
| `class_to_idx_clean.json`     | Maps predicted class indices to clean face labels           |
| `class_to_idx_877.json`       | Maps predicted class indices to distorted face labels       |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The `.pt` file only contains model weights. To use it, the model architecture must be defined in `unified_face_analyzer.py`. Make sure this file is present in the same directory.

---
```
### Notes
test.py will automatically classify whether the image is clean or distorted

Based on the classification, it will route the image to the appropriate sub-model

The correct label will be decoded using the appropriate .json file

```

##  Key Learnings

- Modular pipelines increase flexibility and robustness
- Distortion-aware models perform better than a single mixed model
- MobileNetV3 (small + SE) works well for fast, light face recognition
