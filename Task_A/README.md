# Task_A: Gender Classification with MobileNetV3-Small + SE Attention

This project aims to build a lightweight and accurate deep learning model for gender classification from facial images using the MobileNetV3-Small architecture enhanced with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset organized into gender-based subfolders ("male" and "female").

### Grad-CAM Visualization:
Grad-CAM heatmaps were used to visualize where the model focuses when predicting gender from a face. Results showed attention around eyes, nose, and jawline.

##  Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  Testing:

A separate test.py script is provided that:
*	Accepts a test dataset path (same folder structure)
*	Loads the pretrained model
Evaluate the model on new test data:

```bash
python test.py \
    --model_path mobilenetv3_se_face_recognition.pth \
    --test_path /path/to/test
```

It will output:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Confusion matrix

##  Grad-CAM Visualizations

The project includes tools to generate Grad-CAM attention maps for model interpretability.
A separate util.py script is given to plots and Grad_CAM attention.

## Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates the design and implementation of a lightweight yet powerful deep learning model for face-based gender classification using MobileNetV3-Small enhanced with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention.
By combining MobileNetV3â€™s efficiency with SEâ€™s adaptive feature selection capabilities, the model achieves high accuracy (92%) while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on mobile and edge devices.
Key accomplishments include:
*	Accurate classification with clear performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
*	Visual interpretability through Grad-CAM heatmaps
*	Efficient training pipeline with resource usage tracking
*	Clean dataset integration and evaluation-ready architecture
  
The project also adheres to all submission requirements, including test script support, pretrained weights, and structured reporting. This solution offers a solid foundation for real-world face classification tasks and can be extended to age detection, emotion recognition, or multi-label facial analysis with minimal modifications.

In essence, this project balances accuracy, speed, and explainabilityâ€”delivering a practical and deployable AI solution for facial classification.
